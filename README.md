## Resources

This project is based on these resources:

* ["White Fir Trees Collection Photoscanned For Cycles" (CC 4.0)](https://blendermarket.com/products/white-fir-trees-collection-photoscanned-for-cycles) by Michal Sornat from which I used one tree, scattered it on a box in Blender, exported it as GLTF and added some snow on the needle-texture
* ["Snow 02" texture used on the ground (CC 0)](https://polyhaven.com/a/snow_02) by Rob Tuytel
* ["Snowy Forest Path 01" used as the environment map (CC 0)](https://polyhaven.com/a/snowy_forest_path_01) by Oliksiy Yakovlyev
* ["Randomised Fractal Snowflakes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXTC5LSep3M) was used to create the SnowflakeTexture
* ["2a How to make falling snow three.js"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXpl8durSjA) inspired the particle system to animate the snow so that it falls from the sky
