This project is based on these  resources:

* ["White Fir Trees Collection Photoscanned For Cycles" (CC 4.0)](https://blendermarket.com/products/white-fir-trees-collection-photoscanned-for-cycles) by Michal Sornat from which I used one tree, scattered it on a box in Blender, exported it as GLTF and added some snow on the needle-texture
